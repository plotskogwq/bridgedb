To set up:
 - Install Python 2.4 or later.
 - Install Twisted-Web, Twisted-Mail, PyOpenSSL, and all their dependencies.
 - To run unit tests, "python setup.py test"
 - python setup.py install
 - To generate translation files, run "python setup.py trans" 
 - Run "python setup.py install_data" to install them
 - Edit bridgedb.conf; put it somewhere good.
 - Make sure that the input files referred to in bridgedb.conf exist.
   - You can make a self-signed certificate with
     openssl req -x509 -new -nodes > cert
 - Set up PYTHONPATH to include "~/lib/python2.4/site-packages/".
 - To install Maxmind GeoIP
   - Debian: apt-get install python-geoip
   - Others: http://www.maxmind.com/app/python 

To re-generate and update the i18n files (in case translated strings
have changed in BridgeDB):
 - Run:
     xgettext lib/bridgedb/I18n.py -dbridgedb -oi18n/templates/bridgedb.pot
     msgen -o i18n/en/bridgedb.po --lang=en i18n/templates/bridgedb.pot
     msgmerge -U i18n/de/bridgedb.po i18n/templates/bridgedb.pot

To run:
 - Run "python -m TorBridgeDB bridgedb.conf"

 - When you have new lists of bridges, replace the old files and send the
   process a sighup.

To extract bucket files with unallocated bridges:

 -  Edit the configuration file value 'FILE_BUCKETS' according to your needs.
    For example, the following is a possible configuration:

            FILE_BUCKETS = { "name1": 10, "name2": 15, "foobar": 3 }

    This configuration for buckets would result in 3 files being created for 
    bridge distribution: name1-2010-07-17.brdgs, name2-2010-07-17.brdgs and 
    foobar-2010-07-17.brdgs. The first file would contain 10 bridges from 
    BridgeDB's 'unallocated' pool. The second file would contain 15 bridges 
    from the same pool and the third one similarly 3 bridges. These files can 
    then be handed out to trusted parties via mail or fed to other distribution
    mechanisms such as twitter.

To use with HTTPS:
 - Just connect to the appropriate port.

To use with email:
 - Any mail sent to the email port with a subject or a single line _exactly_
   equal to "get bridges" will get answered, assuming the domain is okay.

To indicate which bridges are blocked:
 - Uncomment or add COUNTRY_BLOCK_FILE to your bridgedb.conf
 - The syntax of the COUNTRY_BLOCK_FILE, 1 entry per line:
   fingerprint <bridge fingerprint> country-code <country code>
 - If this file is present, bridgedb will filter blocked bridges from responses
 - For GeoIP support make sure to install Maxmind GeoIP

To update the SQL schema:
 - CREATE TABLE BlockedBridges ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, hex_key, blocking_country);
 - CREATE INDEX BlockedBridgesBlockingCountry on BlockedBridges(hex_key);
 - REPLACE INTO Config VALUES ( 'schema-version', 2 );
