Soon:
o Send back an email even if there are no bridges
- Check dkim headers for sanity.
- Make the 'magic word' for the email configurable, case-tolerant,
  html-tolerant, and punctuation-tolerant
- make all the rest of the email options configurable.
- bug: the email handler gets really upset when the email doesn't have
  a message-id header in it.

Not now:
- check that incoming IP of email is sane.
- check more email headers for sanity
