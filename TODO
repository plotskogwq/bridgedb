Soon:
o Send back an email even if there are no bridges
o Check dkim headers for sanity.
- Make the 'magic word' for the email configurable, case-tolerant,
  html-tolerant, and punctuation-tolerant
  - for bonus points, make it base64-tolerant
- make all the rest of the email options configurable.
- bug: the email handler gets really upset when the email doesn't have
  a message-id header in it.
- When we hit the end of a period, forget email address history.
- When sending bridges to an email address in the history, check for
  liveness.
. Make bounces go to the right address.
  o Make address sent in "mail from" command configurable.
  - Actually configure it.
- make the bridge list you get back include at least one *non*443
  bridge. turns out sometimes 443 isn't all it's cracked up to be.
- write the ip addresses of the unallocated bridges to a local file,
  so we can give them out manually as needed

Not now:
- check that incoming IP of email is sane.
- check more email headers for sanity

Later:
- document stuff better
- better area division logic
- make all proxies get stuck in their own area.
o implement slightly nicer logging
- add captchas
o decent template for web interface
o decent template for mail interface
- implement 'help' command
- Reload configuration on sighup; not just bridges.
- Reply with locale support.
- Check host option in http
