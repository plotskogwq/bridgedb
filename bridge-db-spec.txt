0. Preliminaries

   This document specifies how BridgeDB processes bridge descriptor files
   to learn about new bridges, maintains persistent assignments of bridges
   to distributors, and decides which bridges to give out upon user
   requests.

   Some of the decisions here may be suboptimal: this document is meant to
   specify current behavior as of Feb 2011, not to specify ideal behavior.

1. Importing bridge network statuses and bridge descriptors

   BridgeDB learns about bridges from parsing bridge network statuses and
   bridge descriptors as specified in Tor's directory protocol.
   BridgeDB SHOULD parse one bridge network status file first and at least
   one bridge descriptor file afterwards.

   BridgeDB scans its files on sighup.

   BridgeDB does not validate signatures on descriptors or networkstatus
   files: the operator needs to make sure that these documents have come
   from a Tor instance that did the validation for us.

1.1. Parsing bridge network statuses

   Bridge network status documents contain the information which bridges
   are known to the bridge authority and which flags the bridge authority
   assigns to them.
   We expect bridge network statuses to contain at least the following two
   lines for every bridge in the given order:

      "r" SP nickname SP identity SP digest SP publication SP IP SP ORPort
          SP DirPort NL
      "s" SP Flags NL

   BridgeDB parses the identity from the "r" line and the assigned flags
   from the "s" line.
   BridgeDB MUST discard all bridges that do not have the Running flag.
# I don't think that "discard" is the right word here: we don't actually
# seem to "Forget they exist".  Instead, we remember that they are not
# running.  (See how parseStatusFile yields a flag that says if the bridges
# are running, and how Main.load sets the bridge's status to running or
# non-running appropriately before passing it to splitter.  At no point here
# does a non-running bridge get "discarded", sfaict). -NM
   BridgeDB memorizes all remaining bridges as the set of running bridges
   that can be given out to bridge users.
   BridgeDB SHOULD memorize assigned flags if it wants to ensure that sets
   of bridges given out SHOULD contain at least a given number of bridges
   with these flags.

1.2. Parsing bridge descriptors

   BridgeDB learns about a bridge's most recent IP address and OR port
   from parsing bridge descriptors.
   Bridge descriptor files MAY contain one or more bridge descriptors.
   We expect bridge descriptor to contain at least the following lines in
   the stated order:

      "@purpose" SP purpose NL
      "router" SP nickname SP IP SP ORPort SP SOCKSPort SP DirPort NL
      ["opt" SP] "fingerprint" SP fingerprint NL

   BridgeDB parses the purpose, IP, ORPort, and fingerprint from these
   lines.
   BridgeDB MUST discard bridge descriptors if the fingerprint is not
   contained in the bridge network status parsed before or if the bridge
   does not have the Running flag.
# See comment above -NM
   BridgeDB MAY discard bridge descriptors which have a different purpose
   than "bridge".
# "MAY" isn't good enough; we need to know whether it's safe to give
# bridgedb a list of non-bridge-purpose descriptors or not.  If it
# discards them, then you shouldn't give bridgedb non-bridge descriptors
# if you _do_ want them handed out.  If it doesn't discard them, then you
# shouldn't give bridgedb non-bridge descriptors _unless_ you want them
# handed out.
   BridgeDB memorizes the IP addresses and OR ports of the remaining
   bridges.
   If there is more than one bridge descriptor with the same fingerprint,
   BridgeDB memorizes the IP address and OR port of the most recently
   parsed bridge descriptor.
# I confirmed that BridgeDB simply assumes that descriptors in the bridge
# descriptor files are in chronological order and that descriptors in
# cached-descriptors.new are newer than those in cached-descriptors.  If
# this is not the case, BridgeDB overwrites a bridge's IP address and OR
# port with those from an older descriptor!  I think that the current
# cached-descriptors* files that Tor produces always have descriptors in
# chronological order.  But what if we change that, e.g., when trying to
# limit the number of descriptors that Tor memorizes.  Should we make the
# assumption that descriptors are ordered chronologically, or should we
# specify that we have to check that explicitly and fix BridgeDB to do
# that?  We could also look at the bridge descriptor that is referenced
# from the bridge network status by its descriptor identifier, even though
# that would require us to calculate the descriptor hash.  -KL
# We should just look at the 'published' dates in the bridges. Call this a bug,
# I'd say. -NM
   If BridgeDB does not find a bridge descriptor for a bridge contained in
   the bridge network status parsed before, it MUST discard that bridge.
# I confirmed that BridgeDB discards (or at least doesn't use) bridges for
# which it doesn't have a bridge descriptor.  What's the reason for
# parsing bridge descriptors anyway?  Can't we learn a bridge's IP address
# and OR port from the "r" line, too?  -KL
# I forget. -NM

2. Assigning bridges to distributors

   A "distributor" is a mechanism by which bridges are given (or not
   given) to clients.  The current distributors are "email", "https",
   and "unallocated".

   BridgeDB assigns bridges to distributors on a probabilistic basis and
   makes these assignments persistent.
# Not exactly probabilistic: it's based on an HMAC hash of the bridge's ID
# and a secret. -NM
   Persistence is achieved by using a database to map node ID to distributor.
   Each bridge is assigned to exactly one distributor (including
   the "unallocated" distributor).
   BridgeDB MAY be configured to support only a non-empty subset of the
   distributors specified in this document.
   BridgeDB MAY define different probabilities for assigning new bridges
   to distributors.
   BridgeDB MUST NOT change existing assignments of bridges to
   distributors, even if probabilities for assigning bridges to
   distributors change or distributors are disabled entirely.
# Why "MUST NOT" here?  This seems like a potentially desirable feature.
# "Does not" would be more accurate. -MN

3. Giving out bridges upon requests

   Upon receiving a client request, a BridgeDB distributor provides a
   subset of the bridges assigned to it.
   BridgeDB MUST only give out bridges that are contained in the most
   recently parsed bridge network status and that have the Running flag
   set.
   BridgeDB MAY define a different number of bridges (typically 3) to be
   given out depending on the distributor.
   BridgeDB MAY define an arbitrary number of rules saying that a certain
   number of bridges SHOULD have a given OR port or a given bridge relay
   flag.

4. Selecting bridges to be given out based on IP addresses

   BridgeDB MAY support one or more distributors that gives out
   bridges based on the requestor's IP address.  Currently, this is
   how the HTTPS distributor works.
   BridgeDB MUST fix the set of bridges to be returned for a defined time
   period.
   BridgeDB SHOULD consider two IP addresses coming from the same /24 as
   the same IP address and return the same set of bridges.
   BridgeDB SHOULD divide the IP address space equally into a small number
   of areas (typically 4) and return different results to requests coming
   from these areas.
# I found that BridgeDB is not strict in returning only bridges for a
# given area.  If a ring is empty, it considers the next one.  Therefore,
# it's SHOULD in the sentence above and not MUST.  Is this expected
# behavior?  -KL
# I also found that BridgeDB does not make the assignment to areas
# persistent in the database.  So, if we change the number of rings, it
# will assign bridges to other rings.  I assume this is okay?  -KL
   BridgeDB SHOULD be able to respect a list of proxy IP addresses and
   return the same set of bridges to requests coming from these IP
   addresses.
   The bridges returned to proxy IP addresses SHOULD NOT come from the
   same set as those for the general IP address space.
   BridgeDB MAY include bridge fingerprints in replies along with bridge
   IP addresses and OR ports.

   The current algorithm is as follows.  An IP-based distributor splits
   the bridges uniformly into a set of "rings" based on an HMAC of their
   ID.  Some of these rings are "area" rings for parts of IP space; some
   are "category" rings for categories of IPs (like proxies).  When a
   client makes a request from an IP, the distributor first sees whether
   the IP is in one of the categories it knows.  If so, the distributor
   returns an IP from the category rings.  If not, the distributor
   maps the IP into an "area" (that is, a /24), and then uses an HMAC to
   map the area to one of the area rings.

   Once the IP-based distributor knows what ring it is handing out bridges
   from, it maps the current "epoch" (N-hour period) and the IP's area
   (/24) to a point in the ring based on HMAC, and hands out bridges at
   that point.

   "Mapping X to Y based on an HMAC" above means one of the following:
      - We keep all of the elements of Y in some order, with a mapping
        from all 160-bit strings to positions in Y.
      - We take an HMAC of X using some fixed string as a key to get a
        160-bit value.  We then map that value to the next position of Y.

   When giving out bridges based on a position in a ring, BridgeDB first
   looks at flag requirements and port requirements.  For example,
   BridgeDB may be configured to "Give out at least L bridges with port
   443, and at least M bridges with Stable, and at least N bridges
   total."  To do this, BridgeDB adds to the results:
      - The first L bridges in the ring after the position that have the
        port 443, and
      - The first M bridges in the ring after the position that have the
        flag stable, and
      - The first N-L-M bridges in the ring after the position that it
        has not already decided to give out.

5. Selecting bridges to be given out based on email addresses

   BridgeDB MAY support one or more distributors that are giving out
   bridges based on the requestor's email address.  Currently, this is how
   the email distributor works.
   BridgeDB SHOULD reject email addresses containing other characters than
   the ones that RFC2822 allows.
   BridgeDB MAY reject email addresses containing other characters it
   might not process correctly.
   BridgeDB MUST reject email addresses coming from other domains than a
   configured set of permitted domains.
   BridgeDB SHOULD normalize email addresses by removing "." characters and
   by removing parts after the first "+" character.
   BridgeDB MAY discard requests that do not have the value "pass" in
   their X-DKIM-Authentication-Result header or does not have this header.
# This means in practice that the incoming mail stack needs to check DKIM
# authentication and set X-DKIM-Authentication-Result.
   BridgeDB SHOULD NOT return a new set of bridges to the same email
   address until a given time period (typically a few hours) has passed.
# Why don't we fix the bridges we give out for a global 3-hour time period
# like we do for IP addresses?  This way we could avoid storing email
# addresses.  -KL
# The 3-hour value is probably much too short anyway.  If we take longer
# time values, then people get new bridges when bridges show up, as
# opposed to then we decide to reset the bridges we give them.  (Yes, this
# problem exists for the IP distributor). -NM
   BridgeDB MAY include bridge fingerprints in replies along with bridge
   IP addresses and OR ports.
   BridgeDB SHOULD periodically discard old email-address-to-bridge
   mappings.
   BridgeDB SHOULD reject too many email requires too frequently from the
   same normalized address.

   To map previously unseen email addresses to a set of bridges, BridgeDB
   proceeds as follows:
     - It normalizes the email address as above, by stripping out dots,
       removing all of the localpart after the +, and putting it all
       in lowercase.  (Example: "John.Doe+bridges@example.COM" becomes
       "johndoe@example.com".)
     - It maps an HMAC of the normalized address to a position on its ring
       of bridges.
     - It hands out bridges starting at that position, based on the
       port/flag requirements, as specified at the end of section 4.

6. Selecting unallocated bridges to be stored in file buckets

# Kaner should have a look at this section. -NM

   BridgeDB MAY reserve a subset of bridges and not give them out via one
   of the distributors.
   BridgeDB MAY assign reserved bridges to one or more file buckets of
   fixed sizes and write these file buckets to disk for manual
   distribution.
   BridgeDB SHOULD ensure that a file bucket always contains the requested
   number of running bridges.
   If the requested number of bridges in a file bucket is reduced or the
   file bucket is not required anymore, the unassigned bridges are
   returned to the reserved set of bridges.
   If a bridge stops running, BridgeDB SHOULD replace it with another
   bridge from the reserved set of bridges.
# I'm not sure if there's a design bug in file buckets.  What happens if
# we add a bridge X to file bucket A, and X goes offline?  We would add
# another bridge Y to file bucket A.  OK, but what if A comes back?  We
# cannot put it back in file bucket A, because it's full.  Are we going to
# add it to a different file bucket?  Doesn't that mean that most bridges
# will be contained in most file buckets over time?  -KL

7. Writing bridge assignments for statistics

   BridgeDB MAY write bridge assignments to disk for statistical analysis.
   The start of a bridge assignment is marked by the following line:

      "bridge-pool-assignment" SP YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS NL

   YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS is the time, in UTC, when BridgeDB has completed
   loading new bridges and assigning them to distributors.

   For every running bridge there is a line with the following format:

      fingerprint SP distributor (SP key "=" value)* NL

   The distributor is one out of "email", "https", or "unallocated".

   Both "email" and "https" distributors support adding keys for "port"
   and "flag" and the port number and flag name as values to indicate that
   a bridge matches certain port or flag criteria of requests.

   The "https" distributor also allows the key "ring" with a number as
   value to indicate to which IP address areas the bridge is returned.

   The "unallocated" distributor allows the key "bucket" with the file
   bucket name as value to indicate which file bucket a bridge is assigned
   to.
