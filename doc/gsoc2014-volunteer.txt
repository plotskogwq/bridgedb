New BridgeDB Distributor
------------------------

Effort Level: Medium
Skill Level: Medium to Medium-High
Likely Mentors: isis, sysrqb

BridgeDB is a Twisted Python system which runs a number of servers, in order
to distribute Tor bridge relays to users in potentially censored regions. Each
of BridgeDB's Distributors uses some unique channel to communicate bridge
addresses to users, currently there is an [https://bridges.torproject.org
HTTPS Distributor], and an Email Distributor. This project would involve
designing and creating a new Distributor for BridgeDB. Some ideas for new
Distributors:

    - A Twitter bot which interacts with Chinese and Farsi speaking
      Twitter users through PMs.
    - A distributor which uses XMPP+OTR to give bridges to users.

It's helpful if you already have some knowledge of Twisted. As part of your
application, please submit a design for a Distributor, as well as supply a
patch for a ticket which demonstrates knowledge of Twisted and Python â€•
preferably for BridgeDB, see the
[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=!closed&keywords=~bridgedb-gsoc-application
'bridgedb-gsoc-application'] Trac tag for some examples of good tickets to
try, or contact isis or sysrqb on IRC to ask for ticket suggestions or advice.
