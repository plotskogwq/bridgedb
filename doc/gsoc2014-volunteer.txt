Number of Positions Available: 2

Project: BridgeDB https://gitweb.torproject.org/bridgedb.git

Difficulty Level: Moderate - Difficult, dependent on proposal and previous experience

Myself (isis) and sysrqb are both looking for students who wish to help Tor by
contributing code to BridgeDB (the program which distributes Tor bridges and
pluggable transport bridges to clients connecting to Tor) through
participation in Google Summer of Code 2014. We are each taking a student, so
if we each find someone someone we want to mentor, then we'll take two
students total. If we only find one student we like, then I suppose sysrqb and
I will just have to fight over that person.

Required Skills and Prerequisite Tasks for Application:
-------------------------------------------------------
  * IRC skills. Lurk in irc.oftc.net#tor-dev, and possibly irc.freenode.net#gsoc as well.

  * Fluent in Python (version 2.7).

  * Proven experience and comfort with asynchronous network programming using
    Twisted.

  * Be comfortable doing git things. Not saying you have to have mad
    git-fu, but we shouldn't have to explain the difference between
    merge/rebase or fetch/pull.

  * Familiarity with documentating code in Sphinx ReStructured Text
    format. (See recent commits in the BridgeDB repository for syntax
    examples, and https://para.noid.cat/bridgedb/ for documentation builds.)

  * Familiarity with writing unittests. (And willingness to do so!)
    Preferably, using `twisted.trial.unittest.TestCase`s. See
    https://coveralls.io/r/isislovecruft/bridgedb for current test coverage.

  * Submit a brief sample of Python code that you're proud of (written by you,
    and for which you've got whatever necessary legal whatever is needed for
    you to share it). It helps if it's Twisted Python code, but it doesn't
    have to be.

  * Fix a BridgeDB ticket. Contact isis or sysrqb on ircs://irc.oftc.net:6697
    in #tor-dev to ask if a particular ticket is a good idea, or to ask for a
    suggestion or help. Eventually, sysrqb and I will tag some tickets with
    "bridgedb-gsoc-application" that we think are good ones to try.

  * Submit a proposal for a distributor (an object which distributes Tor
    bridges to clients in possibly censored/surveilled regions). Current
    distributors include the `bridgedb.Dist.EmailBasedDistributor` at
    bridges@bridges.torproject.org, and the `bridgedb.Dist.IPBasedDistributor`
    which serves pages at https://bridges.torproject.org . Other example ideas
    for bridge distributors are:
        - A Twitter bot which interacts with Chinese and Farsi speaking
          Twitter users through PMs.
        - A distributor which uses XMPP+OTR to give bridges to users.
        - Basically, all the nifty protocol obfuscation tricks which could
          apply to a pluggable transport would likely also apply here.
        - Keep in mind that various adversaries (automated and/or human and/or
          extraterrestrial and/or unknown) will be trying to trick your
          distributor into giving them bridges. Be prepared to come up with
          some sort of safety machanism(s) to protect against this.
        - You should plan to have your code finished, reviewed (and
          revisedâ€¦), tested, approved, and deployed by the end of GSoC. (I
          think this means "at the end of six weeks".)

  * Please send your code sample, a link to your completed BridgeDB ticket
    (which should have your patch(es) attached, or have a link to your git
    repository), and proposal to both isis@torproject.org and
    sysrqb@torproject.org. Additionally CC'ing tor-dev@lists.torproject.org is
    probably a good idea.

  * If accepted, you'll need a google-melange account:

Additional Ways to Earn Bonus Points:
-------------------------------------
  * OTR skills (over IRC/XMPP).

  * Knowledge about the current state and technical mechanisms of real-world,
    deployed censorship/surveillance systems is helpful, though not necessary.
    We will gladly provide continual feedback on design proposals and
    implementation to ensure that the threats posed by various adversaries
    have been taken into account.

  * Major bonus points if you're into test-driven development.

  * Propose building more than one distributor. Each of them still needs to be
    a good idea, and we'll need to make certain it's something you're capable
    of finishing in the allotted timespan.
