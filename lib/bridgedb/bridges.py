class PluggableTransport(object):
    """A single instance of a Pluggable Transport (PT) offered by a
    :class:`Bridge`.

    Pluggable transports are described within a bridge's
    ``@type bridge-extrainfo`` descriptor, see the
    ``Specifications: Client behavior`` section and the
    ``TOR_PT_SERVER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS`` description in pt-spec.txt_ for
    additional specification.

    .. _pt-spec.txt:
        https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/pt-spec.txt

    :type fingerprint: str
    :ivar fingerprint: The uppercased, hexadecimal fingerprint of the identity
        key of the parent bridge running this pluggable transport instance,
        i.e. the main ORPort bridge whose ``@type bridge-server-descriptor``
        contains a hash digest for a ``@type bridge-extrainfo-document``, the
        latter of which contains the parameter of this pluggable transport in
        its ``transport`` line.

    :type methodname: str
    :ivar methodname: The canonical "name" for this pluggable transport,
        i.e. the one which would be specified in a torrc file. For example,
        ``"obfs2"``, ``"obfs3"``, ``"scramblesuit"`` would all be pluggable
        transport method names.

    :type address: ``ipaddr.IPv4Address`` or ``ipaddr.IPv6Address``
    :ivar address: The IP address of the transport. Currently (as of 20 March
        2014), there are no known, widely-deployed pluggable transports which
        support IPv6. Ergo, this is very likely going to be an IPv4 address.

    :type port: int
    :ivar port: A integer specifying the port which this pluggable transport
        is listening on. (This should likely be whatever port the bridge
        specified in its ``ServerTransportPlugin`` torrc line, unless the
        pluggable transport is running in "managed" mode.)

    :type arguments: dict
    :ivar arguments: Some PTs can take additional arguments, which must be
        distributed to the client out-of-band. These are present in the
        ``@type bridge-extrainfo-document``, in the ``transport`` line like
        so::

            METHOD SP ADDR ":" PORT SP [K=V[,K=V[,K=V[â€¦]]]]

        where K is the key in **arguments**, and V is the value. For example,
        in the case of ``scramblesuit``, for which the client must supply a
        shared secret to the ``scramblesuit`` instance running on the bridge,
        the **arguments** would be something like::

            {'password': 'NEQGQYLUMUQGK5TFOJ4XI2DJNZTS4LRO'}

             A "Bridge Line" is how BridgeDB refers to lines in a ``torrc``
             file which should begin with the word ``"Bridge"``, and it is how
             a client tells their Tor process that they would like to use a
             particular bridge.

            return lines which are prefixed with the word 'bridge', as they
